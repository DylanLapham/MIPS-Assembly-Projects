# MIPS-Assembly-Projects

These are some implementations of programs in the low-level assembly language MIPS.

Set 1-MIPS program that takes a user input in the form of a floating point fahrenheit temperature and turns it into the correct celsius temperature.

Set 2-Multiple programs: AddThree takes in 3 numbers from the user and outputs the sum of the three numbers.
                         BCD2Dec translates a BCD number to a decimal number
                         SmallestOfThree takes in 3 numbers from the user and determines the smallest of the three numbers
                         
Set 3-Multiple programs: loops_words takes in two numbers from the user and implements for loops to modify an existing array of numbers based on those two numbers. Utilizes words for the arrays.
                         fibonacci prints out fibonacci numbers up to n amount that is entered by the user.
                         factorial takes in a number from the user and prints out the factorial of that number.

Set 4-More advanced project: Pong in MIPS (work in progress)
