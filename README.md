# MIPS-Assembly-Projects

These are some implementations of programs in the low-level assembly language MIPS.

Set 1-MIPS program that takes a user input in the form of a floating point fahrenheit temperature and turns it into the correct celsius temperature.
Set 2-Multiple programs: AddThree takes in 3 numbers from the user and outputs the sum of the three numbers.
                         BCD2Dec translates a BCD number to a decimal number
                         SmallestOfThree takes in 3 numbers from the user and determines the smallest of the three numbers
Set 3-Multiple programs: loops takes in two numbers from the user and implements for loops to modify an existing array of numbers based on those two numbers. Utilizes words for the arrays.
